## Goals:

|Version|Goal(s)|
|---|---|
|0.1|A Window is being created on play. A Rectangle is being drawn|

|0.4|SpriteSheets and TileMaps can be loaded and displayed. A Map class displays the currently loaded Map|
|0.5|The Map loads a separate CollisionMap - Image and Entities interact with the Map-Collision|
|0.6|Better Map loading system: The Map loads a defined list of resources for its tilemap and when unloading those images are unloaded. Smooth transition between map - switching.|
|0.7|Better Entity - / Object - System. Entities can collide or notify each other on collision. Maybe some kind of messaging system between objects.|
|0.8|Animation System and Particle / Effect System. Display Animation and Particles or Effects which can be triggered by GameObjects on their own!|
|0.9|Music and Sound System. Music is being played on different Maps. GameObjects can play sound effects through the Context|
|1.0|GamePlay. Cinematic scenes. HUD. UI. Inventory. Currency. Designing Monsters. Loot tables. Designing Maps. Story.|
